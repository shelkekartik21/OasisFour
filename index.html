          <p>
            Elon Reeve Musk born June 28, 1971 is an entrepreneur and business
            magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX;
            early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.;
            founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and
            OpenAI. With an estimated net worth of around US$243 billion as of
            February 2022, Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according
            to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the Forbes real-time
            billionaires list. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South
            African father, and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly
            attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age
            17 to avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and
            transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where
            he received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved
            to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided
            instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software
            company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by
            Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded
            online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form
            PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. In
            2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space
            transport services company, of which he is CEO and Chief Engineer.
            In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc.
            (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its
            CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy
            services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla
            Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company
            that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he
            co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
            developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring
            Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the
            Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.

            In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He
            was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars
            and discussed funding the project himself. In October 2001, Musk
            traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Mike Griffin to buy
            refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could
            send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with companies NPO
            Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was
            even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. The group
            returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the
            group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another
            meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million,
            which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that
            could build affordable rockets. With $100 million of his early
            fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded
            as SpaceX, in May 2002. As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and
            also holds the title of Chief Engineer.

            Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by
            Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until
            the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the
            company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led
            the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5
            million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board
            of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the
            company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply
            involved in day-to-day business operations. Following a series of
            escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard
            was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as
            CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009 lawsuit settlement with
            Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with
            Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest
            tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally. In 2021, Musk
            nominally changed his title to Technoking while retaining his
            position as CEO.
